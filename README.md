# Authorization
Course: Computer Security (ECE 305)

This is a Python program that allows only authorized users to access a database of files. The users that are allowed to access the database are located in the "users.txt" file and the permissions for each user can be found in the "auth.txt". The "file*.txt" files are the mock files of the database.
